## Course information

 - Motivations: The huge availability of data of all types stored everywhere (databases, data warehouses, bank transactions, e-commerce, web pages, social networks, etc.) fostered research in a specific area of Computer Science: Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). One of the main steps of KDD is the application of algorithms for Data Mining (DM). DM's objective is to discover human-comprehensible patterns hidden in large amounts of data. DM & KDD are multidisciplinary, overlapping many areas such as Databases, Computational Intelligence, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Information Science, and Statistics. Such methods are omnipresent, leading to a growing interest by researchers, companies, and the government.

 - Objective: This course aims at presenting the knowledge discovery process using data mining methods. The main data mining tasks are studied along with the most well-known algorithms, always focusing on real-world applications.

 - Evaluation: Students' grades will be computed according to three evaluations: weekly homework (10%), Challenge (40%), and final project (teams of two - 50%). Deliverables: homework require a short report with results; the final project requires a "paper-like" full report with motivations, objective, background, methods, experiments, and results. A seminar for the oral presentation of the projects will be set for Oct 25th/26th, 2022.
